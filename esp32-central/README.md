## Project Overview

This project uses the ESP32-S3 microcontroller to manage and control lighting in a secure IoT environment. The ESP32-S3
communicates with a remote server over HTTPS, utilizing encrypted SSL certificates for secure data transmission. The
project is designed for seamless setup and deployment using a Makefile, which handles initialization, building,
flashing, and monitoring processes.

Additionally, the project implements BLE Central and GATT Server functionalities, MQTT integration for message
communication, and (on the ESP32-C3 variant) internal temperature measurement using the microcontroller's built-in
temperature sensor.

## Prerequisites

* **ESP32-S3 development board**
* **USB cable** for programming the ESP32
* **ESP-IDF** (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
* **OpenSSL** for encrypting and decrypting the certificate file
* **MQTT Broker** (e.g., Mosquitto) for testing MQTT functionalities
* **BLE Peripheral Devices** for testing BLE Central capabilities

---

## Setting up ESP-IDF

1. **Download ESP-IDF**: Follow the
   official [ESP-IDF setup guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html) to
   download and install ESP-IDF.
2. **Set up the environment**: Each time you start a new terminal session, set up the ESP-IDF environment by running:
   ```bash
   source /path/to/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```
3. Configure ESP32 Device: Ensure the ESP32-S3 device is properly connected to your system. Identify the serial port to
   use (e.g., `/dev/cu.usbmodemXYZ` on macOS or `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux).

## Secure storage of certificate

To ensure secure communication, this project requires a certificate file (`certs.h`) stored at
`main/components/http_client/include/certs.h`. For security, we encrypt this file and do not store it in plain text in
the
repository. Follow these steps to securely manage this file.

### Encrypting the certs.h file

1. Place the certificate file at main/components/http_client/include/certs.h.
2. Run the following command to encrypt it:
   ```bash
   openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in main/components/http_client/include/certs.h -out
   main/components/http_client/include/certs.h.enc -k <password>
   ```
   Replace `<password>` with a secure password. The resulting `certs.h.enc` file is now encrypted and safe to store in
   the
   repository.

### Decrypting the certs.h.enc file

1. To use the certificate, decrypt it by running:
   ```bash
   openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in main/components/http_client/include/certs.h.enc -out
   main/components/http_client/include/certs.h -k <password>
   ```

   Use the same password entered during encryption. The decrypted `certs.h` file will be created
   in `main/components/http_client/include/` and can now be accessed by the application.

   > **Note**: Never commit the decrypted `certs.h` file directly to the repository.

## Using the Makefile

The Makefile simplifies building, flashing, and monitoring processes for this project, helping you manage the ESP32-S3
firmware more efficiently.

### Makefile Variables

Update these variables as needed to match your environment:

* `IDF_PATH`: Path to the ESP-IDF installation.
* `PORT`: Serial port connected to the ESP32.
* `BAUD`: Baud rate for flashing.
* `TARGET`: Target ESP device (e.g., `esp32s3`).

#### Sample Configuration in the Makefile:

```makefile
IDF_PATH := /path/to/esp/esp-idf
PORT := /dev/cu.usbmodem21101
BAUD := 115200
TARGET := esp32s3
```

### Makefile targets

* **init**: Sets up the ESP-IDF environment and configures the target board.
   ```bash
   make init
   ```

* **build**: Compiles the project.
  ```bash
  make build
  ```

* **flash**: Erases the flash memory, flashes the firmware, and starts the monitor.
    ``` bash
  make flash
  ```

* **erase**: Erases only the flash memory.
    ```bash
  make erase
  ```

* **build-flash**: Builds the project, erases the flash, flashes firmware, and starts the monitor.
  ```bash
  make build-flash
  ```

* **monitor**: Opens the serial monitor to view ESP32 logs.
  ```bash
  make monitor
  ```

* **all**: Executes the full setupâ€”build, erase flash, flash firmware, and monitor.
  ```bash
  make all
  ```

## Example workflow

### Initial Setup and Full Build

For a complete workflow, use the following commands:

```bash
make init
make all
```

### Subsequent Builds and Flashes

After the initial setup, you can simplify with:

```bash
make flash
```

---

## Color-coded output

The Makefile provides color-coded output for easier identification of each step:

* **Blue**: Initialization and flashing.
* **Yellow**: Erase flash status.
* **Green**: Successful task completion.

This makes it easy to follow the process visually during development and debugging.

## Features implemented

### BLE Central and GATT Server

This project implements BLE Central functionality, allowing the ESP32-S3 to scan for and connect to BLE peripheral
devices. The ESP32-S3 acts as a BLE Central device and can interact with peripherals to read and write characteristics.

Additionally, a GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) Server is implemented, enabling the ESP32-S3 to expose its own services
and characteristics to other BLE devices. This allows for two-way communication between the ESP32-S3 and connected BLE
peripherals.

**Key Features**:

* **BLE Scanning**: The ESP32-S3 scans for available BLE devices and filters based on specific criteria.
* **Connection Management**: Handles connections and disconnections with BLE peripherals.
* **Characteristic Read/Write**: Reads data from and writes data to BLE characteristics on connected devices.
* **GATT Server Services**: Defines custom services and characteristics for other devices to interact with.

**Setup Instructions**:

* Ensure that BLE is enabled in the ESP-IDF configuration.
* Use BLE peripheral devices for testing, such as BLE sensors or smartphones with BLE apps.

### MQTT Integration

The project integrates MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for lightweight messaging between the
ESP32-S3 and an MQTT broker. This enables the ESP32-S3 to publish sensor data and subscribe to topics for receiving
commands or configurations.

**Key Features**:

* **MQTT Client**: The ESP32-S3 acts as an MQTT client using the ESP-IDF MQTT library.
* **Publish/Subscribe**: Supports publishing messages to topics and subscribing to topics for incoming messages.
* **QoS Support**: Quality of Service levels are configurable for reliable message delivery.
* **Authentication**: Supports MQTT broker authentication using a username and password.

**Setup Instructions**:

* Install and configure an MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) on your local machine or a server.
* Update the MQTT broker address, port, and credentials in the `mqtt_broker` component configuration.
* Ensure network connectivity between the ESP32-S3 and the MQTT broker.

### Internal Temperature Measurement (ESP32-C3)

> **Note**: The internal temperature measurement feature is implemented on the ESP32-C3 variant, not on the ESP32-S3.

The ESP32-C3 includes a built-in temperature sensor that can measure the internal temperature of the microcontroller.
This project, when run on the ESP32-C3, utilizes this sensor to read the temperature and can publish the readings over
MQTT or display them via BLE characteristics.

**Key Features**:

* **Temperature Reading**: Reads the internal temperature sensor data from the ESP32-C3.
* **Data Conversion**: Converts raw sensor data to human-readable temperature values in degrees Celsius.
* **Data Publishing**: Publishes temperature data over MQTT and/or BLE.
* **Periodic Measurement**: Configurable intervals for temperature measurements.

**Setup Instructions**:

* Use an **ESP32-C3 development board** to utilize the internal temperature sensor feature.
* Ensure that the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) is properly configured in the ESP-IDF settings if required.
* When using the ESP32-S3, this feature is not available, as the ESP32-S3 does not include a built-in temperature
  sensor.
